# Code-Refactor

### Problem
The goal of the assignment was to take the existing code and refactor it. Some things needed to be done were to:
    * make sure all links are functioning correctly
    * make CSS more efficient
        * consolidate CSS selectors
        * consolidate CSS properties
        * organize them to follow semantic structure of html elements
    * include comments before each element or section of the page

### Solutions
Looking at the website initially, I noticed one of the links wasn't working properly. I had to add in an id so the link knows where to go. Going through the code, it was written in a non semantic way. I commented on the changes I needed to make on the HTML and CSS to have it look cleaner for future developers to work on. On the css code, I combined some of the classes that shared the same properties.
